                <h3>What is a WhatsApp Message URL?</h3>
                <p>A WhatsApp Message URL is a URL (link) that when visited enables the visitor to forward a pre-typed message to their WhatsApp contacts.
                <br/>Try it out! Type a message in the first box and hit the Share button or copy the URL generated and visit it.

                <h3>Where can I use a WhatsApp message URL?</h3>
                <p>Whenever you need to spread a pre-typed message, use a WhatsApp Message URL! Type the message, copy the URL generated and share it. 
                    <br/>Some specific use cases would be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have an e-commerce/online store and want your customers to tell their friends about it. You can generate a link on WhatSharer for your message and use that however you want on your site. Alternatively, you could use our default banner.</li>
                        <li>You want your social media audience to share a pre-typed message with their WhatsApp contacts. Sharing a WhatsApp message URL will allow them to just click the link and send the message directly.</li>
                        <li>If you want your friends on WhatsApp to forward a message on WhatsApp, you could just give them the URL and they can click it for single click forward v/s selecting the message and clicking forward. You also avoid those annoying "Forwarded" labels that way!</li>
                    </ul>
                    This is just scratching the surface of possibility! You are restricted by your own ingenuity! <Emoji symbol="🎨" label="palette"/>

                <h3>Why/How should I do bulk messaging with WhatSharer?</h3>
                <p>Sending a single message to multiple people is very easy on WhatSharer. Just type your message in, click the Send button below it and then select the contacts/groups to send the message to. 
                <br/>You might also prefer this because it is easier to type in WhatSharer's message box than the default WhatsApp text box.
